      <p>
        Development is limitless, and that is why I like it. In my career
        previously there were clear limits on what I could achieve and
        contribute, which led me to explore a lot of roles. A career in software
        development is how I see that changing. Outside of work I enjoy playing
        my guitar, eating donuts, drinking coffee and imagining what life would
        be like if I could make my own clothes.
